User-space 6rd (RFC 5569) implementation
----------------------------------------
   The u6rd daemon is a userland implementation of 6rd (RFC 5569) for
   6rd customer edge routers.  It does not provide the functionality of
   6rd relay routers.

   It runs in the user-space using the tun(4) interface and the raw
   socket interface.

Platforms
---------
   The 6rd daemon requires the raw socket and IPv6 support for the
   tun(4) interface.

   Supported operating systems are FreeBSD and NetBSD.

Installation
------------
   % ./configure
   % make
   # make install

Configuration
-------------
   See the u6rd(8) manual page.
