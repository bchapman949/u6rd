User-space 6rd (RFC 5569) implementation
----------------------------------------
   u6rd is a user-space 6rd (RFC 5569) implementation, which uses
   tun(4) and the raw socket interface.

   It runs on the 6rd border router of a 6rd site that is isolated from
   the native IPv6 Internet.  In other words, it does not provide the
   functionality of 6rd "relay" routers.

Platforms
---------
   The 6rd daemon requires the raw socket and IPv4 support for the
   tun(4) interface.

   Supported operating systems are FreeBSD and NetBSD.

Installation
------------
   % ./configure
   % make
   # make install

Configuration
-------------
   See the u6rd(8) manual page.
